# Comic & Film Math Lab

A purpose-built problem generator for John and Andrew that keeps their comic shop conversations and film obsessions at the center of rigorous 7th grade Common Core math practice.

## Highlights

- **Dual Modes**
  - **Teacher Studio** curates standards-tagged prompts with solution sketches and teaching moves.
  - **Student Quest** wraps the same mathematical moves in cinematic missions with revealable strategies.
- **Authentic Contexts** grounded in reimbursement deals, subscription discounts, Comic Con budgets, storyboard planning, lighting ratios, and box-office probability.
- **Full Grade 7 Coverage** across ratios & proportional relationships (7.RP), the number system (7.NS), expressions & equations (7.EE), geometry (7.G), and statistics & probability (7.SP).

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build tools required.

1. Choose **Teacher Studio** or **Student Quest**.
2. Teachers can filter by strand and hide/reveal solution sketches.
3. Students tap into story-driven missions with optional answer reveals.

## Extending the Lab

- Add more generator functions in `app.js` to increase variety.
- Swap contextual data (prices, frame counts, fan survey results) to reflect new conversations with Andrew.
- Export generated prompts as PDFs via the browser's print dialog for quick classroom handouts.

## Standards Referenced

- CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.RP.A.1, 7.RP.A.2, 7.RP.A.3
- CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.NS.A.1, 7.NS.A.3
- CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.EE.B.3, 7.EE.B.4
- CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.G.A.1, 7.G.B.6
- CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.SP.B.4, 7.SP.C.7

These alignments match the problems that emerged from John & Andrew's earlier brainstorming: reimbursements, discounts, sales tax, conversions between single issues and graphic novels, and new filmmaking threads like storyboard pacing, lighting ratios, and probability-based marketing.
